## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CloudLATAM/cloudkit-infra.git
cd cloudkit-infra
```

### 2. Configure Authentication

Set the following environment variables to allow Terraform to authenticate with Azure:

```bash
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="<your-client-id>"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-client-secret>"
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-subscription-id>"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="<your-tenant-id>"
```

### 3. Customize Your Variables

Edit `terraform.tfvars` or define environment-specific variables.

### 4. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

### 5. Review and Deploy

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
